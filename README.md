# Defensive Coding Crash Course Tutorial

This tutorial will emphasize learning about topics, seeing code examples, and spending time coding with the topics learned. Everyone from beginner to expert will be able to learn and push new boundaries in defensive coding techniques.

In keeping the setup as minimal as possible, there are just four requirements to complete prior to attending:

1. Have PHP 7.0+ available locally. This can be installed on your laptop, on a virtual machine, in a Docker container, or however else needed. The operating system used does not matter.
2. Have a way to edit PHP files. This can be an IDE (PhpStorm, Zend Studio, etc.), a text editor (Sublime Text, Text Wrangler, Notepad++, etc.), terminal (emacs, vim, etc.), or any other tool you are most comfortable using.
3. Have a way to run PHP files. This can be through a web browser or terminal/command line.
4. Have a USB port to copy files from a USB flash drive. I will have all of the files needed for the tutorial on flash drives to avoid possible Internet connection issues.

If you have any questions at all, please reach out to me on twitter at @mbniebergall, Slack on phpchat.slack.com, or email at mbniebergall with gmail.

We will be having three team-based coding excersizes. One will focus on input validation and type checking, one will focus on encryption and password hashing, and one focus on unit testing. All code needed will be provided on USB flash drives and will also be available a couple of days prior to the tutorial at https://github.com/mbniebergall/defensive-coding-tutorial.
